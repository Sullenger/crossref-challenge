What libraries did you use? Why did you use them?
    For CSS libraries I used Bulma and PrimeNG. I used PrimeNG for its pagination and dialogs. I tend to use this library for features outside of normal mark-up. I also used Bulma for the fact that it's quick to designate layouts and make a page more responsive.

If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
    If I had more time, I would have liked to create additional filtering functionality, such as an advanced search. My header and footer also didn't get very much attention. I would have liked that to be more polished. For mobile responsiveness, my testing was limited to my browser dev tools. LambdaTest is a testing utility I've used previously, but I no longer have access to it. Another issue I encountered was with pagination. When I navigated into the results and searched for another topic, the page number would not update after loading the correct data. For example, I searched for "Chicken" while on page 3. After that data had loaded it showed that I was still on page 3 even though the data from Page 1 of the new search was displaying. I was able to resolve this thorugh DOM manipulation (toggling a boolean attached to an ngIf), but I would have liked to find a cleaner solution.

Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
    I think I did well on my displayed-works component. I was able to set up safety nets for the fringe issues likely to be encountered. Also, considering the data available, I think the dialog when a work is selected turned out nice. I think my layout is clean, easy to read and user friendly. I chose a Dyslexia friendly font (Helvetica) and incorporated the Interfolio colors into the website design.

Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
    The biggest hurdle was related to unit testing. The last time I worked on unit testing was during my bachelor's degree program. My previous employer did not utilize testing outside of manual testing. I had to brush up on my Jasmine knowledge in order to complete this requirement.
